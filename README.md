## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Popular Styling Library
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - Minimalistic State Management Tool
- [spoo.me](https://spoo.me/api) - Free URL Shortening Service

### What I learned

I used this project to play around React and Tailwind and create a very modern landing apge for a URL shortening service. I also took this opportunity to use Zustand for the first time. I really liked it, its very simple and has less boilerplate code compared to Redux.

### Continued development

I might continue working on this project and add my own URL shortening backend api as a fun side project.
